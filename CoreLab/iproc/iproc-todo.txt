* change all double[][]s to float[][]s
	performance. double precision is not necessary when we're working
	with 8 bit color. (i.e. 32 bits of entropy is completely sufficient
	for storing what amounts to 8 to 10 bits of entropy)

* create a kernel class, make kernels matrices
	methods:
		Kernel(Matrix kernel, String name) 
	members:
		public String name
		
* add higher level methods to Pixel.
	getRed, getGreen, getBlue, getAlpha
	getRedFloat, getGreenFloat, getBlueFloat, getAlphaFloat
	
* add generalization to RawPixel
	Use color itter to allow pixels with or without alpha.
	Use validation methods to allow 'safe' or 'unsafe' pixels, i.e.
		ones that boundary check and ones that do not.

* implement matrix multiplication

* fix convolution edge behavior (how ?)
