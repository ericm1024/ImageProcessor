* tests:
	RawPixel
	Pixel
	
* create classes




* create a kernel class, make kernels matrices
	methods:
		Kernel(Matrix kernel, String name) 
	members:
		public String name
	
* add generalization to RawPixel
	Use color itter to allow pixels with or without alpha.
	Use validation methods to allow 'safe' or 'unsafe' pixels, i.e.
		ones that boundary check and ones that do not.

* fix convolution edge behavior (how ?)

* cache arrays in ImageProcessor (from getGreyscale, etc.)

* create an interpolated image to work with floating point indices
